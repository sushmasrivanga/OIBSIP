Oasis Infobytes Web Development and Designing Intern


Welcome to OIBSIP repository! This repository contains three projects: a calculator, a tribute page, and a to-do web app. Each project is designed to showcase different skills and demonstrate my ability to create functional and visually appealing web applications.

# Projects
## 1. Calculator(Task-1)
The calculator project is a simple web application that emulates a basic calculator. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to use for anyone who needs to perform quick calculations.

To run the calculator project, simply open the Task-1(Calculator).html file in your preferred web browser.

## 2. Tribute Page(Task-2)
The tribute page project is a single-page website dedicated to honoring a notable Swami Vivekananda. It provides a brief biography and highlights the accomplishments and contributions of the Swami Vivekananda being commemorated. The tribute page is designed to be visually appealing and informative, creating a respectful tribute to the Swami Vivekananda.

To view the tribute page, open the Task-2(Tribute Page).html file in your web browser.

## 3. To-Do Web App(Task-3)
The to-do web app project is a dynamic web application that helps users manage their tasks and stay organized. It provides features to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. The to-do web app is built with modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and incorporates a responsive design for optimal user experience across different devices.
